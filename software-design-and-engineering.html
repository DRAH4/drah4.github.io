    <h1>Software Design & Engineering Artifact</h1>

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>
      The artifact I selected is my Full Stack Ticketing System, a project I started before the capstone to practice full stack web development. The original version included a ticket list page and a create ticket page built from a customized Vuexy HTML/CSS template, but all ticket data was hard coded and the pages were mostly static.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Chose This Artifact</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it aligns with the work I want to do in full stack software engineering. It allowed me to design and structure a multiple page application and show how I approach building a clean, organized UI that can later support real functionality. For this milestone, I added a Ticket Edit page and a Ticket View page. The view page includes a comments section along with edit and delete buttons, and the edit page mirrors the create form to prepare for update functionality. These additions complete the basic workflow a user would expect in a ticketing system.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Enhancements</h2>
    <p>For the Software Design and Engineering milestone, I made the following structural improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a Ticket View page that displays the details of a single ticket, including comments.</li>
      <li>Built a Ticket Edit page with a layout matching the create form for future update logic.</li>
      <li>Connected page flow by passing the ticket ID through the URL for viewing and editing.</li>
      <li>Added edit and delete buttons on the view page to reflect real user actions.</li>
      <li>Improved the overall structure of the frontend pages to prepare for backend and database integration.</li>
      <li>Organized the JavaScript into page specific files and added comments for readability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement meets the software design and engineering outcome I planned for in Module One. It strengthened the structure of the application and prepared the front end for future logic in later milestones. It also supports the communication outcome, since I needed to organize and document the code in a clean and readable way.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing this artifact taught me how important layout consistency and page structure are when building a multiple page application. My main challenge was figuring out how much functionality to implement now versus what should be handled once algorithms and the database were added. Focusing on structure first made the pages cleaner and easier to extend later. I do not have any updates to my outcome coverage plan, since this milestone matched exactly what I intended to accomplish.
