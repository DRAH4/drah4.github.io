    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

    <p>
      Working through the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio has helped me understand how my skills have grown and how much more confident I’ve become in software development. The capstone project especially shows this growth. I started with a front-end template and turned it into a functioning full stack ticketing system with a backend, a MySQL database, organized code, and actual workflows. This process helped me see where my strengths are and made it clearer that full stack development is the direction I want to take my career.

      Throughout the program I learned how to communicate better about technical work, whether that meant explaining my code in a review, writing documentation, or describing decisions in a way that makes sense to others. The assignments on data structures and algorithms helped improve the way I approach problems, and I used those skills directly when I built filtering logic and organized the ticket data. The software engineering and database courses taught me how to structure a project so it is maintainable and secure, and I applied that by validating inputs and using parameterized queries in my backend. These experiences shaped the artifacts in my ePortfolio, and together they show how much progress I have made. They also reflect who I am as a developer and the kind of work I want to continue doing as I move into the field.
