      Throughout the Computer Science program I went from just wanting to build “something that works” to actually caring about structure, clarity, and reliability. The capstone project for my Full Stack Ticketing System pulled all of that together. I had to think about the front end, the logic in the middle, and the database underneath it, not just one piece in isolation. It made me realize that I like working on full stack problems where I can see the whole flow from the user clicking a button to data getting saved in the database.

      The coursework helped me get a lot more comfortable reading and writing code that other people could understand. I had to follow requirements, explain my decisions, and match what a real team would expect. That shows up in my capstone through the way I organized my files, commented my JavaScript, and made sure each page has a clear purpose. I also had to improve my communication skills by writing narratives, doing the code review video, and explaining technical work in a simple way.

      On the technical side, I used data structures and basic algorithms to filter and sort tickets, wired up routes and controllers on the Node.js side, and worked with a MySQL database using queries and a real schema. I also had to think about security in simple but important ways, like using parameterized queries instead of string building and not ignoring database errors. Even small choices like not trusting input by default came from the security mindset outcomes in the program.

      Collaborating in teams earlier in the program helped too, because it taught me how to break work into steps, accept feedback, and hand off code that other people can understand. Even though the capstone is mostly solo, I tried to build the ticketing system as if someone else might maintain it later. Overall, this ePortfolio shows that I can design a feature, build it end to end, connect it to a real database, and explain what I did in a clear way. That is the kind of work I want to keep doing as a software engineer.
