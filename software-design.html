    <h1>Software Design & Engineering Artifact</h1>

    <h2>Artifact Description</h2>
    <p>
      The artifact is my Full Stack Ticketing System. I originally started it as a front end project using the Vuexy HTML template. At first it was mostly static pages with hard coded ticket rows and no real flow between pages. This work was started before the capstone, then I used CS 499 to enhance it and turn it into a more complete system.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Chose This Artifact</h2>
    <p>
      I chose this project because it fits the kind of work I want to do as a software engineer. It is a realistic app that an IT or dev team could use to track tickets. It also let me show how I can take a template and turn it into something that is structured, readable, and closer to production quality instead of just a design demo.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Enhancements</h2>
    <p>For the Software Design and Engineering category, I focused on the structure and flow of the application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built a dedicated ticket list page that renders tickets dynamically instead of using static HTML rows.</li>
      <li>Created a ticket view page that shows a single ticket, including its details, status, priority, and description.</li>
      <li>Added a ticket edit page so tickets can be updated using a clear form layout.</li>
      <li>Added a comments section on the view page that lets users add comments linked to a ticket.</li>
      <li>Wired up delete and edit buttons on the view page so the actions feel like a real system flow.</li>
      <li>Organized the JavaScript into page specific files and added comments so the code is easier to follow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement mainly supports the software engineering and communication outcomes. I designed and delivered a more professional quality feature set around creating, viewing, and editing tickets. I also had to think about how to structure the UI, how pages connect to each other, and how to keep the code maintainable with comments and clear functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
    <p>
      While enhancing this artifact I learned how important it is to think about user flow, not just individual pages. For example, I had to make sure the ticket id is passed in the query string, loaded on the view page, and then reused by the edit and delete actions. I also had to be careful with localStorage at first, then later update things to work with the backend. The biggest challenges were keeping the layout consistent and making sure state flowed correctly between create, list, view, and edit. Overall, this work helped me get more comfortable building a small but complete feature set using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a way that looks and feels like a real app.
